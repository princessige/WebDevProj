		 <p>	My name is Princess Ige, and this is my second semester here at Kennesaw State University. I graduated from McEachern High School in 2020 and proceeded to go to Georgia State University that upcoming fall semester. I decided that I wanted to major in Computer Science when I was around 14 or 15 years old. In high school, I actually took a web development course using HTML and won an award for women who love to code. When I got to college, I thought being a computer science major was going to be a blast. Unfortunately, math and I do not get along, but math and computer science are basically best friends. Computer science was just not for me. I took a 'gap year' since I was struggling, and after I got my mind collected, I transferred to KSU for a better experience and a fresh start. I changed my major to Information Technology, and fall 2023 was my first semester here. There was definitely a difference between the two schools, and it kind of took me a while to get adjusted.</p><br>
            

		 <p>	The transition to KSU has been an eye-opening experience for me. Not only has it allowed me to realign my academic and career goals, but it has also introduced me to a vibrant community full of supportive peers and faculty. My decision to change my major from Computer Science to Information Technology was a pivotal moment in my academic journey. This new path feels more aligned with my strengths and interests, particularly in the area of cybersecurity. The courses I've taken so far have challenged me in new ways and have sparked a renewed sense of curiosity and excitement for learning. I believe transferring here was a great decision.</p><br>
           

	

		 <p>	I am excited to finally indulge in all the hands-on activities I am doing in my courses. One of my goals for this year is to be proficient in at least 2 programming languages. Last semester, I got my feet wet in Python, and this semester I am learning more about HTML and Java. As I continue my journey here at KSU, I plan on seeking internships and working on projects that help me build on the knowledge I already have. I also plan to graduate in December 2025, as long as I stick to my plan. I am very optimistic to see what the future holds for me. Maybe one day I'll be a project manager, a data analyst, or head of tech sales. </p>
